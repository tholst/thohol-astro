# Task ID: 12
# Title: Add Playful Dynamic Element
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement a subtle animated or interactive element to enhance user engagement and showcase UI/UX skills.
# Details:
1. Design a tasteful animated element that fits the site's aesthetic
   - Consider options like animated waves in the header, a subtle particle background, or an interactive mascot
2. Implement the animation using CSS animations and/or JavaScript
   - Ensure the animation is performant and doesn't cause layout shifts
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for JavaScript animations
3. Make the animation responsive and appropriate for different screen sizes
4. Ensure the animation is subtle and not distracting from the content
5. Add appropriate controls or interactions if applicable
6. Implement a way to disable the animation for users who prefer reduced motion

# Test Strategy:
Test the animation performance across different devices and browsers. Verify it respects the 'prefers-reduced-motion' media query. Ensure the animation doesn't negatively impact page load time or cause layout shifts.
