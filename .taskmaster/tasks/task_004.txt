# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Homepage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the site homepage that serves as an entry point and showcases recent blog posts.
# Details:
1. Create `src/pages/index.astro`
2. Implement a welcoming hero section with site title and description
3. Display a curated list of recent blog posts
   - Use `getCollection('blog')` to fetch posts
   - Filter for published posts only in production
   - Sort by publication date (newest first)
   - Limit to a reasonable number (e.g., 5-10)
4. For each post preview, show:
   - Title
   - Publication date
   - Brief description
   - Link to full post
5. Add a link to the full blog listing page
6. Ensure responsive layout for all screen sizes

# Test Strategy:
Verify the homepage loads correctly and displays recent posts. Test that links to individual posts work. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes. Ensure production filtering works by testing with some posts marked as `published: false`.
