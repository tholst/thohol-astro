# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Blog Listing Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a page that lists all published blog posts with filtering and sorting options.
# Details:
1. Create `src/pages/blog/index.astro`
2. Fetch all blog posts using `getCollection('blog')`
3. Filter for published posts only in production
4. Sort posts by publication date (newest first)
5. Display each post with:
   - Title
   - Publication date
   - Description
   - Hero image (if available)
   - Link to full post
6. Implement pagination if the number of posts grows large
7. Add metadata for SEO
8. Ensure responsive layout for all screen sizes

# Test Strategy:
Verify all published posts appear in the listing. Test sorting order. Check that links to individual posts work. Ensure production filtering works by testing with some posts marked as `published: false`. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes.
