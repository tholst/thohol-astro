<Layout title="About" description="About Thomas Holst and this blog.">
  <p>
    I am Thomas, a software engineer in Hamburg. This site is a long-lived
    notebook for things I had to understand deeply enough to ship.
  </p>

  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>
    Most posts cover implementation tradeoffs in frontend engineering, APIs,
    deployment workflows, and architecture decisions that become important after
    month six of a project.
  </p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    I work on healthcare-related products and have previously built software in
    startup and enterprise settings. My <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-holst/">LinkedIn profile</a
    >
    has the role history if you want the detailed version.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this format</h2>
  <p>
    Articles here are intentionally practical and technical. The goal is not to
    publish often; the goal is to leave behind notes that are still useful one
    year later.
  </p>

  <h2>Source</h2>
  <p>
    The blog is built with Astro and Markdown. Source code is on
    <a href="https://github.com/tholst/thohol-astro">GitHub</a>.
