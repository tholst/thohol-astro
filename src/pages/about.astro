  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Thomas Holst, a software engineer in Hamburg. I work end-to-end across
    backend, frontend, and infrastructure, with a strong focus on building
    systems that are useful in the real world. Born and raised in Hamburg, still
    living here with my girlfriend and my parents close by.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside work you’ll find me 3D printing, building Lego, watching
    movies/series, and occasionally finding time for a book. I’m also working on
    the classic “eat better, move more” roadmap (still in beta), and I like
    keeping up with AI-assisted coding tools. Navigator since eight — trained on
    paper maps and long road trips with my father.
  </p>

  <h2>Pop Culture Profile</h2>
  <p>
    Kid of the 90s. Former Knight Rider era.<br />
    Pop and hip hop, plus T-Swizzle enthusiast.<br />
    Dr Pepper loyalist.<br />
    Comfort canon: X-Files, Gilmore Girls, How I Met Your Mother.<br />
    Comedy corner: Loriot, Kein Pardon, and the Naked Gun / Hot Shots kind of thing.<br
    />
  </p>

  <h2>Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Role profile:</strong> full-stack engineer with technical leadership
      responsibilities across backend, frontend, infrastructure, and delivery workflows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Core stack:</strong> Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL,
      SQL, Terraform, Kubernetes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Current position:</strong> software engineering at Data4Life (non-profit).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>International collaboration model:</strong> distributed product and
      engineering work across Germany, Singapore, and the United States, including
      partner collaboration with HPI and the Hasso Plattner Institute at Mount Sinai.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Healthcare thread:</strong> from emergency-service volunteering and
      hospital logistics, to medical imaging software, to healthcare co-innovation
      at SAP, and now digital health at Data4Life.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Geography footprint:</strong> hands-on work in Germany, Austria, Singapore,
      and New York.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Collaboration pattern:</strong> co-innovation work with direct customer
      and end-user engagement, user research, and sustained weekly feedback and co-development
      cycles.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Preferred working mode:</strong> avoid waterfall and invented features;
      ship in increments, validate with users early, repeat.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operating range:</strong> comfortable from user insight and ideation
      through design, implementation, delivery, and production.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Communication:</strong> honest, kind, and low-lingo; I prefer direct,
      grounded talk over performance, and I’ll challenge work that shows up without
      a clear rationale and owner.
    </li>
  </ul>
