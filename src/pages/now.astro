  <p>Short status page with current focus areas.</p>

  <h2>Current focus</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keeping this blog minimal and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li>
      Writing a few high-quality technical notes instead of many short posts.
    </li>
    <li>Improving build and content workflows with Astro.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Working style</h2>
  <p>
    Prefer simple systems, explicit tradeoffs, and readable code over complex,
    clever abstractions.
  </p>
</Layout>
